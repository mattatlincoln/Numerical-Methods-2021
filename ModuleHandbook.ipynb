    "- To work with C++ you can use MS Visual Studio which is installed in the computer labs and also is freely downloadable from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). There are many other options and depending on the power of your computer and operating system there may be better options - ask us. <img src='C++_logo.png' width=100px>\n",
    "- to work with Python I recommend Anaconda python which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) - click on the download button then pick the correct installer. I like using Jupyter notebooks – see the notebooks on Blackboard for reminder on how to use them - but there are many other nice working environments.  <img src='python_logo.png' width=100px>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use either of these languages – it would be very beneficial for you to see what parts are essential and what are trivial details of a particular language to try and use both. Would be good for your CV too."
